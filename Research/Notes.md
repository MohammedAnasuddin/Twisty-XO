# How SDE Builds their project
Absolutely, Anas.
If you want to grow into a **professional SDE** and be job-ready, you must **think, plan, and execute like one** — not just write code.

Let me show you the **real-world, structured approach** that top-tier SDEs use when starting, building, and delivering a software project.

---

## 🧠 1. Mindset First: SDE ≠ Just Coder

> A Software Development Engineer **solves problems with systems**, not just syntax.

A good SDE thinks in:

* **Systems**: What's the input, output, state, behavior?
* **Users**: Who is using it? What’s the UX?
* **Scalability**: What happens when usage grows?
* **Codebase**: Is it testable, modular, and readable by others?
* **Team Work**: Can others understand and contribute?

---

## 📊 2. Professional Project Planning in 6 Steps

Here’s the structure **real SDEs follow** for every project (personal or job-based):

---

### ✅ Step 1: **Requirements Gathering**

**You ask**:

* What am I solving?
* Who are the users?
* What should the app *do*, and *not do*?

📝 You write:

* Problem statement
* User stories (e.g., "As a user, I can play a game and undo my last move.")

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Architecture Design**

Before writing a single line of code, you design:

* **Data model**
* **Flowchart** or **state diagram** (you already did this!)
* **Component tree**
* **Folder structure**
* Reusability and separation (UI vs logic vs state)

🛠 Tools: Pen & paper, Figma, Excalidraw, or Miro

---

### ✅ Step 3: **Tech Stack & Tools Setup**

You finalize:

* Frontend: React? Next? Tailwind?
* Backend: Express? Firebase? Supabase?
* Tools: ESLint, Prettier, Git, testing frameworks
* Hosting: Netlify, Vercel, Railway

🧱 You scaffold the project and make the first commit:
`chore: initialized vite + tailwind project`

---

### ✅ Step 4: **Break Into Features (Tasks)**

You don’t try to build everything at once.

Instead, create tasks like:

* [ ] Render 3x3 board
* [ ] Add move on click
* [ ] Implement 3-move stack
* [ ] Show whose turn it is
* [ ] Check for win
* [ ] Reset button
* [ ] Add test cases
* [ ] Add animation

📌 Use GitHub issues, a Notion board, or even a `TODO.md`.

---

### ✅ Step 5: **Build in Iterations (MVP-first)**

SDEs always build **Minimum Viable Product first**, then add:

1. **Core game** logic → win condition
2. **Visuals** → blinking moves, hover states
3. **Feedback** → win message, reset
4. **Extras** → leaderboard, save game, etc.

💬 After every small change:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added win logic"
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: **Testing, Docs, Deployment**

Real-world devs don’t stop at "it works on my machine".

You also:

* Write unit tests (for logic)
* Finalize README with features + screenshots
* Deploy live with Netlify or Vercel
* Share the repo link in your resume/portfolio

## 🧱 How You Should Practice Like an SDE

| Task            | How You Do It                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Build a project | Break into small issues, write commits like a team |
| Add a feature   | Think of inputs, outputs, states                   |
| Code            | Reusable components + clear naming                 |
| Collaborate     | Push clean commits, write README, open issues      |
| Improve         | Ask: Can I test this? Reuse it? Make it modular?   |

---

## ✅ Want to Simulate a Real SDE Experience?

Let’s work like a mini team.
I’ll help you simulate the role of a **solo dev in a team setting**:

* I give you **tickets** (tasks)
* You break them into PR-sized commits
* We review the design
* You write clean messages and organize the repo for others

## TL;DR: How SDEs Plan & Work

| Phase       | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Think    | Understand the problem deeply           |
| ✍️ Design   | Create structure, plan state & data     |
| 🛠 Setup    | Choose tools, scaffold properly         |
| 🔨 Build    | In features, not files                  |
| 🧪 Test     | Check logic, write test cases           |
| 📝 Document | README, commit messages, folder clarity |
| 🚀 Deploy   | Host it live and share confidently      |

Want to continue this project in **real SDE style** from this point on?
Say **“Give me Task 1: MVP Board Rendering”** and we’ll start with feature tickets — like real-world engineers.
